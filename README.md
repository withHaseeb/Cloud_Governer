**Project Summary:**
Cloud Governer is a comprehensive governance project designed to optimize and manage AWS resources efficiently. By leveraging Lambda functions, Cloud Governer enables you to automate compliance checks, enforce security policies, and ensure cost-efficiency. Whether you are a small startup or a large enterprise, Cloud Governer streamlines your AWS governance processes and enhances operational excellence.

Project Scope:
The Cloud Governer project addresses various areas of AWS resource management and optimization:

Securing S3 Buckets: Lambda functions monitor S3 bucket access and enforce security policies, including preventing public access, encrypting data at rest, and logging access activity.

Optimizing EC2 Instances: Lambda functions monitor EC2 instance metrics, such as CPU utilization, and dynamically adjust instance size or capacity based on workload, resulting in performance optimization and cost reduction.

Automating Backups and Disaster Recovery: Lambda functions schedule backups and automate disaster recovery processes, such as copying data to backup S3 buckets or launching new EC2 instances in the event of failure.

Automating Routine Tasks: Lambda functions automate repetitive tasks like database backups, log analysis, and file processing, reducing manual effort and enhancing operational efficiency.

Ensuring Proper IAM Permissions and Roles: Lambda functions enforce IAM policies and roles, including granting least privilege access and rotating access keys, to improve security and compliance.

Cloud Governer empowers organizations to govern their AWS resources effectively, ensuring security, compliance, and cost optimization throughout their infrastructure.
